# traffic-simulation
### traffic_simulation.py
The traffic simulation module contains the classes necessary to run the traffic simulation.


### Traffic Sim Jupyter Notebook
This Jupyter notebook contains all the graphs and data created to demonstrate the ideal speed limit given the simulations constraints.

### advanced.py
The advanced module is a modified copy of the traffic simulation module.  The main difference is this module allows us to change the chance of a slowdown based on location on the road.

### Advanced Traffic Sim Jupyter Notebook
The jupyter notebook contains two main plots which show the position of each vehicle on the 7 kilometer road, for each of the 480 seconds in the simulation. The first plot has a 10% chance of each car slowing down for the first kilometer.  The second plot has a 90% chance of each car slowing down for the first kilometer.  The final section of the notebook displays the average speed and st. dev for each speed limit from 20m/s to 32 m/s.  

### requirements.txt
One can install all necessary dependencies for this module and notebook by running pip3 -r requirements.txt.
